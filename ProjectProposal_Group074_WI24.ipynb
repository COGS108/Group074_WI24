    "Based on different geographical locations, people have access to different resources, climates, and agricultural commodities. Due to these factors, there are various levels of distinctions in regional diets and their consequent health impacts on their related populations. In past research according to the World Population Review,<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) the world’s obesity rate has grown dramatically from 13% to 39% worldwide in the past 50 years. The United States has a high rate of obesity compared to other high-income nations, staying in the 12th highest obesity rate worldwide. However, it is difficult to pinpoint which part of the American diet and lifestyle contributes to higher rates of obesity factors. Research on the relationship between obesity and culture, ethnicity, and race has been done by two MDs, Sonia Caprio, and Stephen R. Daniels.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) Their research has shown that the obesity rate among children varies between different races. Specifically, Hispanic and Black children have a much higher obesity rate than White children. There’s no obvious biological difference between races that will cause a significantly different obesity rate, which raised their concerns about the food habits in the USA may cause a high obesity rate. Yet, no data is supporting their hypothesis. In a global context, different regional diets are associated with diverse health benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, this proposed study seeks to examine the relationship between regional diets and health metrics such as weight and longevity.  \n",

    "Previous Work:\n",
    "Recent research has shown there are “blue zones” where people are known to live longer. Studies have been done in the past regarding BMI and life expectancy comparisons, diet and life expectancy, supplements and bodily function (for example with athletes), etc.\n",
    "As of lately, evidence leans towards the impact plant-based diets have on our health, as opposed to consuming animal products. Food and living conditions are something that we do not fully know and understand, but progress is being made every day to better our knowledge.\n",

  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We believe that diets in regions that have more nutritional variety and lower caloric intake yield a healthier lifestyle, in terms of longevity through life expectancy and mortality rates, and obesity rates measured with BMI. This will be due to having less processed foods more typical in larger countries requiring a larger populace to feed (in turn lowering food quality). We must consider confounding variables that may have an effect to our metrics, such as socioeconomic status, access to healthcare, environmental factors, etc."

    "1. The ideal data should should include a large variety of countries that either fairly represent the region, or just a generalized region that can represent the countries (e.g. Southeast Asia, Northwest Europe, Central America, etc.). From these regions/countries, we can have specifics in terms of macronutrients and micronutrients, and the main source(s) of those nutrients, providing an answer to the typical diet in that region. Additionally, there will be population-to-nutritional information such as average caloric intake, obesity rate, weight/BMI, life expectancy. As a bonus, there could be additional information such as socioeconomic status and perhaps the percentage of processed foods present in the typical diet in that region.\n",

    "The data collected in this is already publicly available through resources such as Kaggle. There may be issues in terms of representation, if we do not find all countries in a dataset that can give us a proper true answer for what the healthiest diet is, but can be generalized by regions. There should not be biases in the research collected in these databases, but the inference of socioeconomic status in less wealthy countries may produce a prenotion that their diets are inferior to those that are wealthier. To combat these issues, we will ensure to collect a diverse set of data that is most representative of countries/regions while focusing on the nutritional information of a region’s diet."
